TODO (apart from make the thing work)
	* Acknowledge David McKay's book (Garfield pictures) for the idea
	* On hover of middle and right canvases, show wrong pixels in white and right pixels in black. Maybe use the value of pixel to indicate the size of the error? (An option)
	* Store settings with a cookie?
	* Fork me on github
	* Add in the remaining codes
	* Compute the diffs (in main thread) on mouse enter and leave;
	* Or compute the diffs in workers?
